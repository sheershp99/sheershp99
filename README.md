## Hello there,

From here, you can navigate to all my data science/analyst projects created using various datasets such as store sales dataset, breast cancer dataset, airlines dataset etc,  from different sources such as Kaggle, Maven Analytics etc. <br><br>
My proficiency in data analytics starts from simple technology like Microsoft Excel to Power BI finally touching the complex data analysis techniques and machine learning models for regression, classification & clustering using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, BeautifulSoup & Scikit-Learn.
